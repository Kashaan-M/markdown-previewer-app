# A markdown previewer app which you can run in your browser to write markdown

This app was built using a **customised react toolchain** which involved the following notable libraries / plugins / tools.

* react
* react-dom
* babel/core
* webpack
* webpack loaders (style-loader, html-loader, css-loader etc.)
* minification plugins and tools
* [Marked Library]("marked.js.org/)  for converting the markdown into HTML
and more

I hope you find this app beneficial for your day to day usage

Oh forgot to mention, I had to build this project for "FrontEnd Development Libraries Certification"
